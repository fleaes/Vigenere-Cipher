Vigenere Cipher - Encryption and Decryption

Date Published: 12/10/23

## Overview
This program allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Vigenere Cipher. The Vigenere Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.

The program is written in C++ and follows a modular structure. It consists of the following key functions:

**void getMessageAndKey():** Takes user input for the message and key.

**std::string vigenereEncrypt(const std::string& input, const std::string& key):** Encrypts the input message using the Vigenere Cipher.

**std::string vigenereDecrypt(const std::string& input, const std::string& key):** Decrypts the input ciphertext using the Vigenere Cipher.

**void displayASCII():** Displays an ASCII art thumbs-up message.

## Instructions
1. Open the source code file ('vigenere.cpp') and compile it in your preferred IDE.
   
2. Run the compiled program, and follow the on-screen prompts to choose between encryption or decryption.
   
3. Enter your message and key when prompted.
   
4. View the encrypted or decrypted result displayed on the console.

Note: Ensure that your message and key consists of alphabetic characters only.
